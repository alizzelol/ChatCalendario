# ChatCalendario
##Introduction
This app is the merger of Calendario and Adae.Chat, to other of my repositories.
I did them separatedly at first, just to know how they could work, I'm still learning.
When both of them worked as I wanted them to do, I decided to merge them, that it's the final goal of my project of the stage of DAM.

## Goals
The main goal of this app is to have a calendar functional and a chat in it. 
In the calendar we can see the events submit from the teachers for the parents to be able to sign up for the childrens to go to class.
The chat is in the app, so the teachers and parents can communicate outside others line of communications, a private chat only to discuss matters of the Asociation.

## Structure
The structure is a combination of the [calendar] (https://github.com/alizzelol/Calendario) and the [chat](https://github.com/alizzelol/Adae.Chat).
